# CppCoro - A coroutine library for C++

This is a fork of [cppcoro](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro) library by Lewis Baker.

The changes in this fork are:
* Got rid of `experimental` stuff
* Added CMakeLists.txt for the build
* Removed all the stuff what doesn't compile on Linux (mainly net/file related)
*
